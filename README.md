This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project contains an interactive world map to display football teams from that specific area.\
When clicking an area or a country, if that area has at least one registered football team, it will show in a list all the football teams there.

Once you click on a team, it will show the details of said team and also the active player squad.\
Clicking on a player name will bring up a more refined detail of the player.
